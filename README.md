'This image contains a physics problem in Chinese related to the concept of pressure. Here is a translation and explanation of the problem and the requirements:\n\n---\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\n1. As shown in the figure, an object A with a weight of \\( G_0 \\) is placed on a horizontal table. The density of object A is \\( \\rho_0 \\). There is a container with a base area \\( S \\) that contains a certain liquid (the thickness of the container walls is ignored). The weight of the liquid in the container is \\( G \\), and the depth of the liquid in the container is \\( h \\). An external force is applied to just submerge object A in the liquid (the liquid does not overflow, and A does not touch the bottom of the container). The change in pressure at the bottom of the container due to the liquid is \\( \\Delta P \\). \n\nFind:\n\n(1) The density of the liquid in the container.\n\n(2) When an external force is applied to just submerge A in the liquid and keep it stationary, find the pressure that the container exerts on the table.\n\n---\n\n**Solution Approach:**\n\n(1) Determining the density of the liquid in the container (\\( \\rho \\)):\n\nTo find the density of the liquid, we can use the formula for liquid pressure \\( P = \\rho g h \\), where:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure at the bottom of the container,\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the liquid,\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n- \\( h \\) is the depth of the liquid.\n\nSince the pressure at the bottom is due solely to the weight of the liquid, we can also express this pressure as:\n\\[ P = \\frac{G}{S} \\]\n\nEquating both expressions for pressure:\n\\[ \\rho g h = \\frac{G}{S} \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{G}{Sgh} \\]\n\n(2) Finding the pressure the container exerts on the table when object A is submerged:\n\nWhen the object A is submerged, it displaces an equivalent volume of liquid. The buoyant force exerted by the liquid on object A is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid.\n\nThe buoyant force \\( F_b \\) can be calculated as:\n\\[ F_b = \\rho_{liquid} \\cdot V_{displaced} \\cdot g \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\rho_{liquid} \\) is the density of the liquid determined in part (1),\n- \\( V_{displaced} = \\text{Volume of } A = \\frac{G_0}{\\rho_0 g} \\)\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ F_b = \\rho_{liquid} \\cdot \\frac{G_0}{\\rho_0 g} \\cdot g = \\rho_{liquid} \\cdot \\frac{G_0}{\\rho_0} \\]\n\nThe weight the container exerts on the table when A is submerged would be the sum of the weight of the liquid (G) and the effective weight of A in the liquid. The effective weight of A is its actual weight minus the buoyant force.\n\nThus, the pressure \\( P_{container} \\) is:\n\\[ P_{container} = \\frac{G + (G_0 - F_b)}{S} \\]\n\nThese steps provide a systematic approach to solving the given physics problem.'
